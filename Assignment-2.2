*****ASSIGNMENT 2.2*****
1. Find what Is a step function In For Loop
   Increment values by 2 In the Range instead of 1
       In every iteration, a for loop increases the counter variable by 
       a constant. A for loop with a counter variable sequence of 0, 2, 4,
       6 would increment by 2 per iteration.
       INPUT:
       for x in range(0, 12, 2):
       print(x)
       OUTPUT:
       0
       2
       4
       6
       8
       10
       
2. Find how to make a For Loop infinite
    An Infinite Loop in Python is a continuous repetitive conditional loop
    that gets executed until an external factor interferes in the execution
    flow, like insufficient CPU memory, a failed feature/ error code that 
    stopped the execution, or a new feature in the other legacy systems 
    that needs code integration. A few types of Infinite Loop in Python 
    include the While statement, the If statement, the Continue statement,
    and the Break statement.
    INPUT:
        i = 0
        while i <= 10:
            print{"Run forever!"}
    OUTPUT:
        Run forever!
        Run forever!
        Run forever!
        Run forever!
        Run forever!
        Run forever!
        Run forever!
        Run forever!
        Run forever!
        Run forever!
        Run forever!
        Run forever!
        Run forever!
        Run forever!
        Run forever!
        ....
        Run forever!
3. Figure out how to add values In a Tuple
    Add parentheses around the added value with a comma before the right 
    parentheses to make it a tuple with one value. Use concatenation to 
    add the previous tuple to the end of the original tuple to create a 
    new tuple with an added value at the end.
    INPUT:
        a_tuple = ("a", "b")
        added_value = "c"
        added_value_tuple = (added_value,)
        new_tuple = a_tuple + added_value_tuple
        print(new_tuple)
    OUTPUT:
        ('a', 'b', 'c')
