*****ASSIGNMENT 1.1*****
1. Practice Comparison & Assignment Operators with different values(4 sets)
    ***ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS***
    *Add & Assign
        a = 5
        b = 8
        a += b
        print(a)
    *Subtract & Assign
        a = 5
        b = 8
        a -= b
        print(a)
    *Multiply & Assign
        a = 4
        b = 6
        a *= b
        print(a)
    *Divide & Assign
        a = 3
        b = 5
        a /= b
        print(a)
    *Modulus & Assign
        a = 2
        b = 5
        a %= b
        print(a)
    *Division(Floor) & Assign
        a = 3
        b = 5
        a //= b
        print(a)
    
    ***COMPARISON OPERATOR***
    *Equal To
        a = 5
        b = 5
        print(a == b)
    *Not Equal To
        a = 4
        b = 5
        print(a != b)
    *Greater Than
        a = 8
        b = 2
        print(a > b)
    *Less Than
        a = 4
        b = 9
        print(a < b)
    *Greater Than Equal To
        a = 5
        b = 5
        print(a >= b)
    *Less Than Equal To
        a = 4
        b = 5
        print(a <= b)

2. Practice If And Else statement With the following sentence:
a. If it snows I will go out Else I will Not
b. If it rains frogs will dance
    *CODE FOR STATEMENT (a):
        snow = 1
        if snow == 1:
            print("I will go out")
        else:
            print("I will not go out")
    *CODE FOR STATEMENT (b):
        rain = 1
        if rain == 1:
            print("Frog will dance")
        else:
            print("Frog will not dance")
