*****ASSIGNMENT 1.0*****
1. Why do we have the name Float?
    They represent real numbers and are written with a decimal point dividing the integer and fractional parts.

2. Use Terminal to open Apps (Write the commands)
    >>> print('C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\\firefox.exe')
    C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe
    >>> print(r'C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe')
    C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe

3. Practice all rhe Arithmetic Operators with four different SETS of values
    *ADDITION
        a = 2
        b = 3
        add = a + b
        print(add)
    *SUBTRACTION
        i = 10
        j = 6
        sub = i - j
        print(sub)
    *MULTIPLICATION
        m = 8
        n = 4
        mul = m * n
        print(mul)
    *DIVISION
        p = 9
        q = 3
        div = p / q
        print(div)
    *FLOOR DIVISION
        p = 9
        q = 3
        div = p // q
        print(div)
    *MODULUS
        r = 15
        s = 3
        mod = r % s
        print(mod)
