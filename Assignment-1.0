*****ASSIGNMENT 1.0*****
1. Why do we have the name Float?
    They represent real numbers and are written with a decimal point dividing the integer and fractional parts.

2. Use Terminal to open Apps (Write the commands)
    >>> print('C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\\firefox.exe')
    C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe
    >>> print(r'C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe')
    C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe

3. Practice all rhe Arithmetic Operators with four different SETS of values
    *ADDITION
        a = 2
        b = 3
        add = a + b
        print(add)
    *SUBTRACTION
        i = 10
        j = 6
        sub = i - j
        print(sub)
    *MULTIPLICATION
        m = 8
        n = 4
        mul = m * n
        print(mul)
    *DIVISION
        p = 9
        q = 3
        div = p / q
        print(div)
    *FLOOR DIVISION
        p = 9
        q = 3
        div = p // q
        print(div)
    *MODULUS
        r = 15
        s = 3
        mod = r % s
        print(mod)
        
        
*****ASSIGNMENT 1.1*****
1. Practice Comparison & Assignment Operators with different values(4 sets)
    ***ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS***
    *Add & Assign
        a = 5
        b = 8
        a += b
        print(a)
    *Subtract & Assign
        a = 5
        b = 8
        a -= b
        print(a)
    *Multiply & Assign
        a = 4
        b = 6
        a *= b
        print(a)
    *Divide & Assign
        a = 3
        b = 5
        a /= b
        print(a)
    *Modulus & Assign
        a = 2
        b = 5
        a %= b
        print(a)
    *Division(Floor) & Assign
        a = 3
        b = 5
        a //= b
        print(a)
    
    ***COMPARISON OPERATOR***
    *Equal To
        a = 5
        b = 5
        print(a == b)
    *Not Equal To
        a = 4
        b = 5
        print(a != b)
    *Greater Than
        a = 8
        b = 2
        print(a > b)
    *Less Than
        a = 4
        b = 9
        print(a < b)
    *Greater Than Equal To
        a = 5
        b = 5
        print(a >= b)
    *Less Than Equal To
        a = 4
        b = 5
        print(a <= b)

2. Practice If And Else statement With the following sentence:
a. If it snows I will go out Else I will Not
b. If it rains frogs will dance
    *CODE FOR STATEMENT (a):
        snow = 1
        if snow == 1:
            print("I will go out")
        else:
            print("I will not go out")
    *CODE FOR STATEMENT (b):
        rain = 1
        if rain == 1:
            print("Frog will dance")
        else:
            print("Frog will not dance")
